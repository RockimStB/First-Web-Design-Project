<h1>Political Gains</h1>
<p>From 1833 and throughout the rest of the colonial period, Grenada's government was administered by the British Windward Islands Administration. In 1877, however, Grenada became a Crown Colony. In 1957, the Federation of the West Indies took the place of the British Windward Islands Administration, which was dissolved. The Federation collapsed just a few short years later, in 1962.<br/>

Britain tried to form yet another small federation of its Caribbean territories, including Grenada, but this failed as well. In 1967, Grenada became a state within the British Commonwealth. Seven years later, Grenada gained its independence.<br/>

In 1979, leaders attempted to establish a Communist government. In 1983, the Governor General requested that the U.S., Jamaica, and other Eastern Caribbean countries invade Grenada to halt these efforts. December 1984 marked the next free election, and Herbert Blaize and the New National Party (NNP) won 14 of 15 government seats.</p><!--Taken from http://caribya.com/grenada/history/-->
