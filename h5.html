<h1>Mordern Elections</h1>
<p>The NNP remained in power until 1989, but many members left the party in 1986 and 1987 to form the National Democratic Congress (NDC). This group became the official opposition party to the NNP. Blaize himself left the NNP to form The National Party (TNP) in August 1989, but died in December of that same year. This split in the NNP resulted in the formation of a minority government. Ben Jones succeeded Blaize as prime minister until constitutionally scheduled elections in March 1990, in which the NDC came out on top by winning seven seats. Two members of the TNP and one member of the Grenada United Labor Party also took seats. In 1995, the NNP took the majority of the seats, and Dr. Keith Mitchell took the role of leader.

The government is currently working to expand tourism while protecting Grenada's natural resources. A well-developed system of National Parks is helping to keep Grenada's environment pristine and give visitors a delightful tropical experience.</p>
