<h1>French Interest</h1>
<p>The French explorers on Martinique turned their eyes southward toward Grenada and laid claim to land there in 1650, calling the island Grenade. They purchased much of the island's land from the Caribs with beads and tools, and bought the island itself from the British. Tensions quickly escalated. The French were not content with their purchased portion of land and attempted to take control of the entire island.<br/>

This fight for the island spawned Grenada's most famous historic moment. Caribs jumped from what the French then called Le Morne de Sauteurs, "Leaper's Hill." However, the French spent the better part of the next century trying to maintain control of the island while the British attempted to take the island back. In fact, St. George's Harbour is guarded to this day by Fort George and Fort Frederick, built to protect the island from the British.<br/>

The Treaty of Paris in 1763 gave control of the island back to the British. The French again took the island in 1779, and the Treaty of Versailles returned the island once again to the English in 1783. The British quickly moved to import slaves and begin cultivating sugarcane Ten years later, another French-Revolution-inspired revolt took place, but this 1795 uprising was quashed, and Grenada remained under British rule. Black planter Julian Fedon led the island slaves in this violent rebellion, and race relations continued to be strained from the time that the revolt was put down until slavery was abolished in 1834. Fedon's Camp is now a popular historical spot.</p> <!--Taken from http://caribya.com/grenada/history/-->
