<h1>Agricultural Development</h1>
<p>Though Grenada initially produce sugarcane, there were difficulties with the crop. King George III's botanical adviser, Sir Joseph Banks, opened the door to spice production on this island by introducing nutmeg in 1782. Cocoa was also widely produced at this time.<br/>

Though Grenada was not the only place in the world to produce nutmeg, it quickly rose in importance because of its location. Europe had been importing nutmeg from than Dutch East Indies, but Grenada soon became the favored supplier due to its closer location. This style of agriculture led to the fall of the large plantation and the rise of the yeoman farmer. As such, the abolition of slavery was not as harmful to the nation's economy as it was on many other islands.</p> <!--Taken from http://caribya.com/grenada/history/-->
